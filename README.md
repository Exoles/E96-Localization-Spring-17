Collect data with collectData.py
collectData.py calls movingScript.sh to organize results into a single folder

Use combine.py to generate the csv file output from the results folder created by collectData.py
Then, taking this csv file, manually add in the expected quadrant output (eg 1,0,0,0 for quad 1; 0,1,0,0 for quad 2) for each input.
